# RetireIncome_FHE

A privacy-preserving platform for personalized retirement income planning. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows users to input encrypted asset data and retirement goals, enabling secure simulation of withdrawal strategies to plan stable retirement cash flows while protecting financial privacy.

## Overview

Retirement planning requires analyzing sensitive financial data, including assets, liabilities, and income goals. Traditional planning tools often expose personal financial information, which can create privacy risks:

* Users may be reluctant to share detailed financial data
* Advisors or platforms can inadvertently access sensitive asset information
* Accurate simulations without privacy compromise are challenging

RetireIncome_FHE addresses these issues by allowing encrypted input data and performing homomorphic computations to simulate various withdrawal strategies, enabling personalized retirement planning without exposing user information.

## Features

### Encrypted Financial Inputs

* Users submit encrypted asset and liability data
* Retirement goals are encrypted to ensure confidentiality
* All computations are performed on encrypted data using FHE

### Personalized Withdrawal Simulations

* Evaluates multiple withdrawal strategies for retirement income
* Projects potential cash flows under different scenarios
* Provides guidance on sustainable and personalized withdrawal plans

### Privacy-Preserving Recommendations

* Generates individualized strategies without revealing user-specific data
* Protects sensitive financial information from platform operators
* Ensures data security even during complex financial simulations

### Analytics & Insights

* Aggregates anonymized, encrypted data to provide generalized insights
* Helps advisors or platforms improve planning algorithms without accessing individual data
* Enables secure evaluation of multiple retirement scenarios
